# Good Morning

I am Knight Shrestha. I am from Nepal. I am a beginner learning to make apps that cater to my personal interest. 

## Projects

[Light Novels](https://github.com/Death-Knight-552/123_baka.git) : It is the first project I actually put effort into. This is a light novel database app. You can add details manually or add using [Anilist](https://anilist.co/). You can add download links to the app but it is illegal. Currently, I am trying to add authentication and cloud backup features.
